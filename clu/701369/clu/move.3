	Currently, CLU can only run on a DECSYSTEM-20 under TOPS-20, release 3
or higher.
Your system should have at least 256K of primary memory.
Our implementation exists on MIT-XX.  The file <CLU>HOWTO.MOVE
gives some top-level documentation on which files you need and/or want.
Everything you need is in the <CLU> or <CLU.*> directories, except our
text editor TED, which is in <SUBSYS>.
You will need a fair
amount of disk space for the stuff unless you only want the EXE and
info files.  At the least, you will need about 450 pages.
Being on the net,
you may not want all the sources.
	The system reliability is good
to very good, so you shouldn't have much trouble.
We will fix bugs that you find, but you can't expect immediate response.
Of course, we cannot be responsible for maintaining anything
that you modify.
	If you do decide to take
the system, we would like a message back that you have done so, for our
records.  Feel free to send mail and/or link to RWS@MIT-XX if you have
further questions.
