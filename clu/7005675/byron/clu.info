An efficient implementation of the CLU programming language/system is now
available for the VAX under 4.1bsd.  The user interface is nearly identical
to the TOPS-20 version of CLU, and includes a compiler, linker, assembler,
run-time system, extensive debugging environment, and a powerful real-time
display text editor (written in CLU) with a number of CLU-related features.
The CLU reference manual is available from Springer-Verlag, Lecture Notes in
Computer Science 114.  The system is available for free with the proviso
that it not be used for commercial gain.  The complete system (all sources
and binaries) is about 16Mb; a bare bones system is about 3Mb.  The system
is not available over a network; to get a copy, send a written request
specifying VAX/4.1bsd and a magtape to
	Bob Scheifler
	MIT Laboratory for Computer Science
	545 Technology Square
	Room 522
	Cambridge, MA 02139
We (currently) pay the return postage.  The default tape format will be
	tar cb 20 .
of a directory hierarchy.  In this format, an 800 foot magtape will suffice.
If you want a different format, make sure you specify it.  All we have is a
TS-11 drive.  And please, no queries about a VMS version.  We are starting
work on one, but don't hold your breath.  And no, we don't have a version
for any other machines or operating systems except the 20 under TOPS-20.
