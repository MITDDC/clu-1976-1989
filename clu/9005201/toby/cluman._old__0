.chapter Expressions

.para
An expression in CLU evaluates to an object in the CLU
universe.  This object is said to be the result or value 
of the expression.
When we refer to the type of an expression, we mean
the type of this object.
The order of evaluation of subexpressions is left
to right.  However, users should not depend upon
this ordering to obtain side effects needed in 
other parts of the expression.
The following sections describe the different kinds of
expressions.

.section Literals

.para
Integer, real, character, string and boolean
literals are expressions. The correct syntax for
literals is given in section ??.
The type of a literal expression is the
type of the object named by the literal.
In other words, true is of type bool,
"abc" is of type string, etc.

.section Variables

.para
Variables are identifiers which name
objects of a given type.
The scope of a variable is from
the point of declaration to the
end of the smallest enclosing 
scoping unit (see section ??
for description of scoping units).

.section "Procedure, operation and iterator names"

.para
Procedures may be defined in procedure modules,
or in a cluster, as operations of the type.
To distinguish between the two,
we will refer to those defined in clusters
as operations rather than procedures.
The syntax for naming procedures, operations, and iterators is given below. 

.para
Procedure names are identifiers which may
be followed by an optional parameter list.
The syntax for a procedure name expression is
.show
idn lcurly [const lcurly ,const rcurly ] rcurly
.eshow
The scope of the identifier is global.
The same identifier may not be redeclared 
in any other modules.
The constants are parameters(see section ??).

.para
The type of a procedure name expression is
.show
proctype( lbkt type_spec lcurly , type_spec rcurly rbkt )lbkt returns rbkt lbkt signals rbkt
.eshow
where 2returns* has the form
.show
returns (type_spec lcurly , type_spec rcurly )
.eshow
and 2signals* has the form
.show
signals (exception lcurly , exception rcurly ).
.eshow
The lists of type_specs correspond in number and typee
to the lists of arguments and return values of
the procedure named in the expression.
Similarly, the exception list corresponds to the exceptions
of the named procedure.
(The syntax for exceptions is given in section ??).

.para
Operation names are names of procedures which are 
operations of a cluster.
Operation names have the form:
.show
type_spec $ name lcurly [const lcurly , constrcurly ] rcurly
.eshow
2Names* have no scope.
They must be unique only within a cluster.
The operation name expression always consists of the
name preceded by type_spec $.
.para
The type of an operation name expression is
.show
proctype(lcurly type_spec lcurly , type_specrcurly rcurly )lbkt returns rbktlbkt signals rbkt
.eshow
where returns and signals are as in procedure types.

.para
The form of an iterator name which is part
of a cluster is
.show
type_spec $ name lcurly [ const lcurly , const rcurly ] rcurly
.eshow
If the iterator is not in a cluster,
the form is:
.show
idn lcurly [ const lcurly , const rcurly ] rcurly
.eshow
The type of an iterator name expression is
.show
itertype ( lcurly type_spec lcurly , type_spec rcurly rcurly)lbkt yields rbkt lbkt signals rbkt
.eshow
where 2yields* has the form:
.show
yields (type_spec lcurly , type_spec rcurly )
.eshow
The lists of type_specs correspond to 
the argument list and return value list of the iterator named.
The exception list similarly corresponds to the
list of exceptions signalled by the named iterator.

.section Invocations

.para
Invocations of procedures, operations, and iterators
have the form
.show
primary (lbkt expression lcurly , expressionrcurly rbkt )
.eshow
where primary is an expression which evaluates to a procedure
or iterator object.
The expressions are the actual arguments of the invocation.
So
.show
p(x, y)
.br
int $ add (a, b)
.br
int $ from_to_by (low, high, 2)
.eshow
are invocation expressions.
The type of an invocation expression is
the type of the return value.
Iterators may only be invoked in a for staement.
(see section ?? for the explanation of for statements)

.section "Components of compound types"

.para
CLU provides two compound types in the language.
In addition, users may define other compound types.
Simple notations may be used for naming components of any
types with fetch and store operations,
or get and set operations.

.subsection "Fetch and Store"

.para
Any types which have fetch and store operations, including
arrays, can use the following expressions to name elements
of the objects.
.show
primary[expression]
.eshow
This expression is syntacticaly equivalent to:
.show
type_of_primary $ fetch(primary, expression)
.eshow
unless it appears on the left hand side of an assignment,
in which case it translates to:
.show
type_of_primary $ store( primary, expression, expression2)
.eshow
where expression2 is the expression on the right hand side
of the assignment.
In the case of arrays, 2expression*
represents the index of the element being fetched or stored.
Primary evaluates to the array object being accessed.
It is assumed that user-defined types making use of
this notation will follow this convention,
but no check is made to ensure this.
The translation to the expanded form is purely
syntactic.
If the type of 2primary* does not have the appropriate
fetch or store operation, or the number or types of arguments
do not match, a type error will occur during
type checking.

.subsection "Get and Set operations"

.para
There is also a 'syntactic sugaring' for
naming components of records and objects of user-defined
types having get and/or set operations.
The form of these expressions is:
.show
primary.name
.eshow
This is syntactically equivalent to:
.show
type_of_primary $ get_name(primary)
.eshow
Primary must evaluate to an object of
a type with a get_name operation.
Otherwise, a type-checking error
will occur.
If this expression appears on the left
hand side of an assignment, it is instead translated to:
.show
type_of_primary $ set_name(primary,expression)
.eshow
where 2expression* is the expression on the
right hand side of the assignment.

.section "Constructing arrays and records"

.para

     Constructors are expressions in CLU which have
been provided to enable users to create and initialize
arrays and records.  Constructors are not provided
for user-defined types.

.subsection "Array constructors"

The array constructor has the form 
.show
type_spec$[ lbkt index_expression: rbkt 
lbkt expression lcurly ,expression rcurly ]
.eshow
Index_expression is an expression which evaluates to an
integer.
The effect of this expression is to create an array
with low bound equal to the value of index_expression,
and the values of the array elements equal to the
expressions in the expression list.
The size of the array is equal to the number of expressions
listed.
2Type_spec* must be an array type.

.subsection "Record constructors"

The general form of a record constructor is:
.show
type_spec${field{,field}}
.eshow
Type_spec must evaluate to a record type(see section 2)
Field has the form
	name{,name}:expression

The effect of this constructor is to create a new object
of type 2type_spec*, and in each component name place the
value of the corresponding expression.

.section "Binary operations"

.para
CLU allows infix notation to be used
as a 'shorthand' for the following binary
operations.
The table shows the infix operators and
the equivalent expanded form for each 
binary operation.
The type_spec for each operation is derived from
the type of the first operand.
.show
Infix form			Expansion

expr1 ** expr2		type_spec$power(expr1,expr2)
expr1 // expr2		type_spec$mod(expr1, expr2)
expr1 / expr2		type_spec$div(expr1, expr2)
expr1 * expr2		type_spec$mul(expr1, expr2)
expr1 || expr2		type_spec$concat(expr1,expr2)
expr1+expr2		type_spec$add(expr1,expr2)
expr1-expr2		type_spec$sub(expr1,expr2)
expr1<expr2		type_spec$lt(expr1,expr2)
expr1<=expr2		type_spec$le(expr1,expr2)
expr1=expr2		type_spec$equal(expr1,expr2)
expr1>=expr2		type_spec$ge(expr1,expr2)
expr1>expr2		type_spec$gt(expr1,expr2)
expr1~<expr2		~(expr1<expr2)
expr1~<=expr2		~(expr1<=expr2)
expr1~=expr2		~(expr1=expr2)
expr1~>=expr2		~(expr1>=expr2)
expr1~>expr2		~(expr1>expr2)
expr1&expr2		type_spec$and(expr1,expr2)
expr1|expr2		type_spec$or(expr1,expr2)
.eshow

CAND and COR

.para
Two other binary infix operators are allowed.
These are the 'conditional and' operator, CAND,
and the 'conditional or' operator, COR.
.show
expression1 CAND expression2  
.eshow
is the boolean AND of expression1 and
expression2.  However, if expression1 is false, expression2 is never evaluated.
The types of expression1 and expression2 must be boolean.
.show
expression1 COR expression2  
.eshow
is the boolean OR of expression1 and expression2,
but expression2 is not evaluated unless expression1 is false.
The type of expression1 and expression2 must be boolean.

.section "Unary Operators"

Syntactic sugars for two unary operations exist.

-expression   is equivalent to t$minus(expression)
              where t is the type of expression

~expression   is equivalent to t$not(expression)
              where t is the type of expression

.section Precedence

.para
When an expression is not fully parenthesized, the
proper nesting of subexpressions might be ambiguous.
The following precedence rules are used to resolve
such ambiguity.
The precedence of each operator is given in the
table below.  Higher precedence operations are performed first.

1expression1 . name*  (the sugar for get_name) and
1expression1[expression2]*   (the sugar for fetch(expression1,expression2)
have the highest precedence.

Unary operators have precedence over binary operators.

The precedence for binary operations is as follows:

operator	precedence

**			5
//			4
/			4
*			4
||			3
+			3
-			3
<			2
<=			2
=			2
>=			2
>			2
~<			2
~<=			2
~=			2
~>=			2
~>			2
&			1
CAND			1
|			0
COR			0

The order of evaluation for operators of the
same precedence is left to right.  However,
depending on this order when using expressions
which have side effects is strongly discouraged.

.section "Conversion Expressions"

.para
There are no implicit type conversions in CLU.
Three conversion expressions exist for doing
explicit conversions. (A conversion statement
for oneof types also exists and will be discussed
in section ??.)

The three conversion expressions are:
.show
up(expression)
down(expression)
force[type_spec](expression)
.eshow
Up and down may only be used within the body of a cluster operation.
Up changes the type of the expression from the representation type
of the cluster to the abstract type.
Down converts the type of the expression
from the abstract type to the representation type.

.para
Force[type_spec] is the name of the procedure
which takes an object of type any
as an argument and converts it to an object
of type 2type_spec*.
The argument must have base type 2type_spec*.
