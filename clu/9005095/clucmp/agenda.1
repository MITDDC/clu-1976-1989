* Fix bug that allows use of constants across clusters.


* Add a switch to turn off FORCE.


The linenumber on an error message about the wrong idn on and end <clustername>
  is the linenumber for the token following the idn.

Look at what happens when you say
	rules = array[rules]
  and then later try to iterate over rules$elements.


Allow types as free external references.  I need a macro to give me a
  type descriptor for type_of(external).


Implement the force statement, if possible.


Come up with a short, simple, readable form for DU specs, and implement it.


Document, document, document.
